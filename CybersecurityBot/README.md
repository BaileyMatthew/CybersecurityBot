CybersecurityBot is a C# console-based chatbot designed to educate users about cybersecurity in an engaging and interactive way. With a blend of voice greetings, colorful ASCII art, typing effects, and a natural language input system, this chatbot simulates a friendly conversation with a virtual cybersecurity assistant named Cyber. It covers essential topics such as phishing, strong passwords, two-factor authentication, VPNs, malware, and moreâ€”empowering users with practical knowledge to stay safe online. The application demonstrates principles of modular design by separating functionalities into dedicated classes such as VoicePlayer, AsciiArt, UserInteraction, and ChatBot. This project takes inspiration from best practices in user-centered chatbot development and public cybersecurity education resources (Microsoft Security Blog and Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)).
